# Reconstructing-East-Asian-Data-Assimilation 

Code to reproduce figures from the paper "Reconstructing East Asian Temperatures from 1368 to 1911 Using Historical Documents, Climate Models, and Data Assimilation" by Eric Sun, Kuan-hui Elaine Lin, Wan-Ling Tseng, Pao K. Wang and Hsin-Cheng Huang ([arxiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21790)). 

## Organization

### Code 

Detailed descriptions of the code and usage instructions are available in `Code/README.md`.

### Data

Detailed descriptions of the data and usage instructions are available in `Data/README.md`.

#### REACHES Data:

Reconstructed from historical document records, this dataset includes information on location (longitude, latitude), levels, and time (years).
